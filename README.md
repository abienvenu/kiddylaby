Kiddy Laby - A Unity Microgame

Kiddy Laby is a tiny two-player physics game.

It is meant to be played by a single controller, each player using one stick. Each stick controls one ball. The player controlling the highlighted ball should try to hit the other. When they hit, the highlights switches to the other balls, and the roles are reversed.

The code is free to use and modify.

The music is free as well : https://soundcloud.com/legrandblond/kiddy-laby
